# Even more pointers, arrays and strings

Pointers in C is an effective way to reassign the value of a certain variable without changing the variable. Basically what pointers does is that instead of pointing to the variable's value, it points to the value memory.
Every variable at declaration has it value stored in memory, in C, you can access the memory(location) of a variable by using the amper sign (&) - printf("%n " &variable-name).
